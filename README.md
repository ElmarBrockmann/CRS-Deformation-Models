CRS-Deformation-Models
======================

This repository holds the artefacts and workings of the "Deformation model functional model" project team established by the CRS DWG at the Montreal virtual meeting on 15 June 2020. 

The purpose of this team is to define the functional model(s), methods and workflows for computing coordinate offsets resulting from seismic and certain geodynamic and anthropogenic processes.  This work will be used to support developing
a standard for the deformation model functional model and/or format.

The motivation for this work is to support unambiguous and timely communication of deformation models from producers, typically national geodetic agencies, to the geospatial and positioning communities that require them.  
This is becoming increasingly critical as our dependence on global positioning systems and our requirements for accurate positioning increase.

The terms of reference for this project team proposes the following steps for this work. 

* Defining the term "deformation functional model" (DFM);
* Establishing the use case(s) of a DFM;
* Defining the user needs for a DFM;
* Evaluating existing deformation functional models and methods;
* Designing a DFM fit for its intended purpose as defined by the project team; 
* Ensure the DFM addresses model uncertainty and model validity;
* Develop a strategy for promulgating the model as a standard for the geodetic community.
* Develop an encoding structure for the functional model (when grid, refer to GGXF).

The work will be conducted under the auspices of the OGC CRS DWG in close collaboration with the CRS DWG project team developing the "Gridded Geodetic Exchange Format (GGXF)" and with IAG (International Association of Geodesy) WG 1.3.1 on "Time-dependent transformations between reference frames in deforming regions".
