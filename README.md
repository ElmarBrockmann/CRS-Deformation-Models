CRS-Deformation-Models
======================

The next virtual meeting of this project team will be at 4pm EDT (8pm UTC) on 24 August 2020.  Details for joining the meeting will be posted here once they are available.

This repository holds the artefacts and workings of the "Deformation model functional model" project team established by the CRS DWG at the Montreal virtual meeting on 15 June 2020. 

The purpose of this team is to define the functional model(s), methods and workflows for computing coordinate offsets resulting from seismic and certain geodynamic and anthropogenic processes.  This work will be used to support developing
a standard for the deformation model functional model and/or format.

The motivation for this work is to support unambiguous and timely communication of deformation models from producers, typically national geodetic agencies, to the geospatial and positioning communities that require them.  
This is becoming increasingly critical as our dependence on global positioning systems and our requirements for accurate positioning increase.

The terms of reference for this project team proposes the following steps for this work. 

* Defining the term "deformation functional model" (DFM);
* Establishing the use case(s) of a DFM;
* Defining the user needs for a DFM;
* Evaluating existing deformation functional models and methods;
* Designing a DFM fit for its intended purpose as defined by the project team; 
* Ensure the DFM addresses model uncertainty and model validity;
* Develop a strategy for promulgating the model as a standard for the geodetic community.
* Develop an encoding structure for the functional model (when grid, refer to GGXF).

The work will be conducted under the auspices of the OGC CRS DWG in close collaboration with the CRS DWG project team developing the "Gridded Geodetic Exchange Format (GGXF)" and with IAG (International Association of Geodesy) WG 1.3.1 on "Time-dependent transformations between reference frames in deforming regions". 

## Active discussions

The currently active discussions are:

* [Refine the abstract definition](https://github.com/opengeospatial/CRS-Deformation-Models/issues/2) of "deformation model"
* [Refine the working definition](https://github.com/opengeospatial/CRS-Deformation-Models/issues/3) of "deformation model" which sets the scope for this project team
* [Refine the questionnaire](https://github.com/opengeospatial/CRS-Deformation-Models/issues/1) proposed to provide a catalogue planned, current, and historic deformations models which can inform the requirements of the deformation model functional model

## Collaboration

This is a public repository - everything is visible to anyone coming to this
website.  If you wish to be an active contributor with write access then you 
will need [join github](https://github.com/join) if you haven't already.  Once
you are signed on to github please raise a [new issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/CRS-Deformation-Models/issues/new) with a request to be added.  If you would like to be included on the 
[Project Team](https://github.com/opengeospatial/CRS-Deformation-Models/wiki/Project-team) page then include a brief biography and a photo.  This is not 
required - be aware that everything on the page is visible to the public -  but it is good to have faces for names!  

Also once you have a github id you are encouraged to click the "Watch" button at the top of this page so that you will be notified of postings in the issues log.  Ideally we can capture most of the discussion in the issue logs where they will be recorded and easily searchable.  We will create an issue for each major discussion topic.
