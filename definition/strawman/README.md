# Context

These two "straw man" definitions of the deformation model were written completely 
independently by Kevin Kelly and Chris Crook to provide a basis for discussion
at the inaugural project team meeting on 13 July 2020.  The results are very 
different.  Kevin's definition is an abstract definition of deformation model 
in the broadest sense, and provides an overarching broad definition.  Chris' 
definition is more in the nature of a working definition that attempts to 
precisely define and limit the scope of this work.

During the meeting we only managed to discuss the abstract definition in any
detail.
