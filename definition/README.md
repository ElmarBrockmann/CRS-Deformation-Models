Definition documents
====================

This folder contains the abstract definition and working definition of 
deformation model.  The abstract definition provides a high level view 
of what a deformation model and some related terms mean, akin to a glossary.
The working definition is focussed on the definition within the context of 
coordinate operations and sets the scope of work for this project team.

These are not static documents, it is likely they will be revised over the 
course of the project.  If you wish to comment on these documents please use
the github issues to do so:
